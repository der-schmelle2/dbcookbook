Concept
-------
This book is written in a cookbook style. There is always a problem,
the corresponding solution, some discussions, and any related information.

This makes it easier to find your problem through the world of DocBook. :)


Target Group
------------
It is assumed you have a decent knowledge about XML and DocBook. It doesn't
hurt if you know CSS and XSLT.

As such, it is aimed more for DocBook developers than writers.
