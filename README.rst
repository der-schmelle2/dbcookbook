Mission
-------
The DocCookBook project aims to create a collection of cookbook-style
solutions released under an open source license for the international 
DocBook community.

Concept
-------
This book is written in a "cookbook" style. The book contains "topics"
which are divided into a problem, the corresponding solution, some 
discussions, and optional related information.
It is very easy just to go to the table of contents and see if there
is something useful that fits to your problem.
Solutions are usually written in a procedural style which contains
several steps.


Target Group
------------
It is assumed you have a decent knowledge about XML and DocBook. It doesn't
hurt if you know CSS and XSLT.

As such, it is aimed more for DocBook developers than writers.


Contribute
----------
Do you miss anything? Have you spotted an error? Have an idea about how
to improve the book? Great! If you want to contribute to the book, just
clone my repository on Sourcforge and send me patches. Here is how to do
it:

#. Download Mercurial from http://mercurial.selenic.com and install it
on your system.
#. Clone my Sourceforge repository with the Mercurial command hg:
::
  $ hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/doccookbook/code doccookbook-code
#. If you want to create a new topic, decide in which chapter it could
belong (markup, common customizations, structure, fo, html, or any
other). For example, if you want an addition to DocBookÂ´s structure
chapter, use the existing template and copy it:
::
  $ hg copy en/xml/topic.empty.xml en/xml/structure/topic.foo.xml
(where 'foo' is an abstract term; replace it with something meaningful.)
#. Open the XML file which contains a chapter element. In our example, it would
be en/xml/dbc-structure.xml. Scroll to the <xi:include> elements and
insert the following code:
::
  <xi:include href="structure/topic.foo.xml"/>
#. Open the XML file en/xml/structure/topic.foo.xml and write your
topic.
#. When you are finished, create a diff:
::
  $ hg diff > foo.patch
#. Send the diff to me.
