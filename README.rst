Mission
-------
The DoCookBook project aims to create an open source book about DocBook and the DocBook XSL 
stylesheets written in a cookbook-style manner and released under a Creative Commons license.


Concept
-------
This book is written in a "cookbook" style. The book contains "topics"
which are divided into a problem, the corresponding solution, some 
discussions, and optional related information.
It is very easy just to go to the table of contents and see if there
is something useful that fits to your problem.
Solutions are usually written in a procedural style which contains
several steps.


Target Group
------------
It is assumed you have a decent knowledge about XML and DocBook. It doesn't
hurt if you know CSS and XSLT.

As such, it is aimed more for DocBook developers than writers.


Structure of the Book and Organization
--------------------------------------

The main file is "en/xml/DocBook-Cookbook.xml". It contains xi:include
elements which refers to chapters, appendices and other second level
elements.

  # Struture of Book with Main Chapters 
  en/xml/DocBook-Cookbook.xml
  |
  +-- 5.1/        # (1)
  |
  +-- common/     # (2)
  |
  +-- db/         # (3)
  |
  +-- epub/       # (4)
  | 
  +-- fo/         # (5)
  |
  +-- html/       # (6)
  |
  +--- structure/ # (7)

  (1) Contains the DocBook Schema and possible customizations
  (2) Contains topics to common customizations
  (3) Contains topics to DocBook's markup
  (4) Planned: will contain customizations to EPUB output format
  (5) Contains topics to FO customizations
  (6) Contains topics to HTML, XHTML, and other customizations based on HTML
  (7) Contains topics how to manipulate DocBook's structure


Some topics contain directories which stores XSLT, XML, or other example files.
In some cases these are incorporated into the XML source, sometimes they are
just lying around for testing purposes.

Each topic is a self-contained matter of a specific problem and its solution
with discussion. Use the skeleton file "en/xml/topic.empty.xml"  as a starting point.
It contains the basic structure and you just need to add the flesh of your topic.


Contribute
----------
Do you miss anything? Have you discovered an error? Have an idea about how
to improve the book? Great! If you want to contribute to the book, you can
do it in different ways:

* Write me a mail to <tom_schr (AT) web.de> and send me your comments
* Extend the tickets (Ideas for New Topics) at http://sf.net/p/doccookbook/tickets/
* Clone my repository on Sourcforge and send me patches

Here is a procedure about how to clone the repository:

1. Download Mercurial from http://mercurial.selenic.com and install it on your system.

2. Clone my Sourceforge repository with the Mercurial command hg:
::
  $ hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/doccookbook/code doccookbook-code

3. If you want to create a new topic, decide in which chapter it could belong (markup, common customizations, structure, fo, html, or any other). For example, if you want an addition to DocBookÂ´s structure chapter, use the existing template and copy it (where 'FOO' is an abstract term; replace it with something meaningful):
::
  $ hg copy en/xml/topic.empty.xml en/xml/structure/topic.FOO.xml

4. Open the XML file which contains a chapter element. In our example, it would be en/xml/dbc-structure.xml. Scroll to the <xi:include> elements and insert the following code:
::
  <xi:include href="structure/topic.foo.xml"/>

5. Open the XML file en/xml/structure/topic.foo.xml and write your topic.

6. When you are finished, create a diff:
::
  $ hg diff > foo.patch

7. Send the diff to me.
