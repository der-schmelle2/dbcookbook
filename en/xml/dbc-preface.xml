    </footnote>―I always felt there is a gap. This gap could be 
    bridged with a guide that only concentrates on problems and their solution
    in a concise manner. Until now nobody wrote
    a book that combines possible problems, pitfalls, <quote>how to do
    this</quote>, and the benefits in a cookbook style. My book is
    intented to be such a book. However, to be clear, it <emphasis>does
      not</emphasis> seek to replace any other information, be it a
    printed or an online resource. It aims for
      <emphasis>enhancing</emphasis> the world of DocBook with a
    different view. </para>
  <para>
    This book is a collection of topics, specific to a certain problem
    written mostly as step-by-step instructions. It covers very easy
    topics or demanding ones 
    
     The difficulty can range from very easy to 
    demanding. The more challenging problems need also knowledge from
    different domains (XSLT, CSS, etc.)
  </para>
  <para> The topics are mostly based on my own experiences with DocBook
    and the DocBook XSL stylesheets. However, it also includes questions
    and answers from other sources: mostly the DocBook mailinglists, but
    also other sites that I have found. It is the nature of such topics
    that there might be some overlap with other sources. When other
    authors inspired me, I have included their names. If you think your
    name is missing, please let me know. </para>
  <para>As I have learned (and still do) a lot from the masters of DocBook, 
    it is time to give something back. What you are reading is the first
    draft of the fruits of these efforts.  
    Currently, this book is available under a
    Creative Commons license (see <xref linkend="legalnotice"/> if you
    want to know more). I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I
    enjoy writing it. </para>

    <title>Audience</title>
    <para>This book covers topics which range from very easy to pretty
      demanding. The more challenging problems need also knowledge from
      different domains (CSS, FO, XSLT, etc.)  As such, this book does not and 
      cannot attempt to teach you DocBook or any such related technology 
      (with the exception of <xref linkend="dbc.markup"/>). If you want to 
      learn DocBook or need  some help with XML, search elsewhere. There 
      are plenty of information available either online or printed.   
    </para>
    <para>This book is aimed at DocBook users who write <emphasis>and</emphasis> 
      seek answers for their problems. However, with some try-and-error it 
      can also be useful for ordinary writers who wants to customize their 
      documents. For readers who want further information are some links included 
      in the <citetitle>See Also</citetitle> section at the end of each topic.

    <para>By no means is this book complete. As this book is based on
      technologies like CSS, XML, (X)HTML, and XSLT, it is always a good
