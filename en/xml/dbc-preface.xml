  <para>
    DocBook is a XML format to write documentation mostly for hard-
    and software, but is not limited to this domain. With the help of
    the DocBook XSL stylesheets, text can be published into different
    target formats. </para>
  <para>
    Although there are helpful and valuable documentation like the
      <citetitle xlink:href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg51/en/html/docbook.html"
        >DocBook&#xa0;5: The Definitive Guide</citetitle> from <personname>
      <firstname>Norman</firstname>
      <surname>Walsh</surname>
    </personname> and <personname>

    </personname>'s <citetitle xlink:href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/"
      >DocBook XSL</citetitle> book, until now
    nobody wrote a book that combines the <emphasis>best of both
    worlds</emphasis>. My book is intented to be such a book. However, 
    it <emphasis>does not</emphasis> want to replace the prior mentioned 
    de facto standards. It aims for <emphasis>enhancing</emphasis> 
    the world of DocBook.
  </para>
  <para>
    My book is a collection of problem-and-solution scenarios
    written in a cookbook style. It is the nature of such a topic that
    there might be some overlap with the books above. However, 
    it also goes beyond them to get a better and deeper understanding
    from the world of DocBook. I think, we benefit from different
    opinions and sights.
  </para>
  <para>
    The scenarios are mostly based on my own experiences with DocBook 
    and the DocBook XSL stylesheets. However, it also includes questions 
    and answers from other sources: mostly the DocBook mailinglists, but
    also other sites that I have found. When other authors inspired me, 
    I have included their names. If you think your name is missing,
    please let me know.
  </para>
  <para>
    As I have learned a lot from the masters of DocBook, it is time to
    give something back. This book is written and available under a 
    Creative Commons license. I hope the DocBook community will find it useful.

    <title>Audience</title>
    <para>This book does not attempt to teach you DocBook or any other
      related technology (with the exception of <xref
        linkend="dbc.markup"/>). It is targetted more for DocBook
      developers who seek concise examples for their problems. However,
      with some try-and-error it can also be useful for ordenary writers
      who wants to customize their documents. For readers who want further
      information are some links included in the <citetitle>See
        Also</citetitle> section at the end of each topic. </para>

    <para>By no means is this book complete. As this book is based on
      technologies like CSS, XML, (X)HTML, and XSLT, it is always a good

        <answer>
          <para>This can have several reasons: it is already planned but
          not written yet or I was not aware of this issue. Probably it
          is just a lack of time. If you think, you have covered or know
          some topic, I would really appreciate it if you contribute
          your ideas. Just fill out a ticket on <link
