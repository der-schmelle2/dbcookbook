  <para>According to its <phrase

      <quote>DocBook is a schema (available in several languages
      including RELAX NG, SGML and XML DTDs, and W3C XML Schema)
      maintained by the DocBook Technical Committee of OASIS. It is
      particularly well suited to books and papers about computer
      hardware and software (though it is by no means limited to these

      XSL</citetitle> book, until now nobody wrote a book that combines
    the <emphasis>best of both worlds</emphasis> in a cookbook style. My
    book is intented to be such a book. However, it <emphasis>does
      not</emphasis> seek to replace the prior mentioned de facto
    standards. It aims for <emphasis>enhancing</emphasis> the world of
    DocBook with a different view. </para>
  <para>
    My book is a collection of topics, specific to a certain problem.
    
    Most topics contain step-by-step instructions to simplify your
    tasks for DocBook. If you want to dive deeper, I have collected
    links for further reading.
  </para>
  <para>
    The topics are mostly based on my own experiences with DocBook 
    and the DocBook XSL stylesheets. However, it also includes questions 
    and answers from other sources: mostly the DocBook mailinglists, but
    also other sites that I have found. It is the nature of such topics that
    there might be some overlap with other sources. When other authors inspired me, 
    I have included their names. If you think your name is missing,
    please let me know.
  </para>
  <para> As I have learned a lot from the masters of DocBook, it is time
    to give something back. This book is written and available under a
    Creative Commons license. I hope the DocBook community will find it
    useful. </para>

    <para>This book does not attempt to teach you DocBook or any other
      related technology (with the exception of <xref

      developers who seek concise examples for their problems. However,
      with some try-and-error it can also be useful for ordenary writers
      who wants to customize their documents. For readers who want further
      information are some links included in the <citetitle>See

          <para>This can have several reasons: it is already planned but
