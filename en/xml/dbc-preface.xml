  <para>
    DocBook is a XML format to write documentation mostly for hard-
    and software, but is not limited to this domain. With the help of
    the DocBook XSL stylesheets, text can be published into different
    target formats. </para>
  <para>
    Although there are helpful and valuable documentation like the
      <citetitle xlink:href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg51/en/html/docbook.html"

      >DocBook XSL</citetitle> book, until now
    nobody wrote a book that combines the <emphasis>best of both
    worlds</emphasis>. My book is intented to be such a book. However, 
    it <emphasis>does not</emphasis> want to replace the prior mentioned 
    de facto standards. It aims for <emphasis>enhancing</emphasis> 
    the world of DocBook.

  <para>
    My book is a collection of problem-and-solution scenarios
    written in a cookbook style. It is the nature of such a topic that
    there might be some overlap with the books above. However, 
    it also goes beyond them to get a better and deeper understanding
    from the world of DocBook. I think, we benefit from different
    opinions and sights.
  </para>
  <para>
    The scenarios are mostly based on my own experiences with DocBook 
    and the DocBook XSL stylesheets. However, it also includes questions 
    and answers from other sources: mostly the DocBook mailinglists, but
    also other sites that I have found. When other authors inspired me, 
    I have included their names. If you think your name is missing,
    please let me know.

    As I have learned a lot from the masters of DocBook, it is time to
    give something back. This book is written and available under a 
    Creative Commons license. I hope the DocBook community will find it useful.

    <para>You should know at least DocBook, have heard (and
      even better worked!) with CSS and XSLT. This book does not
      attempt to teach you DocBook, XSLT, CSS, XSL-FO, or any other
      related technology. </para>

    <para>By no means is this book complete. As this book is based on
      technologies like CSS, DocBook, (X)HTML, and XSLT, it is always a
      good idea to seek other information.</para>
