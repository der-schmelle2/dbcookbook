    <para>Leading is the distance from one baseline to the next, or in
      other words, the <quote>interlinear space.</quote> It is not the
      same as the line height. Unfortunately, the FO specification named
      the property for influencing the leading
        <property>line-height</property> which makes it confusing. </para>
    <para>The DocBook stylesheets introduce the parameter
        <parameter>line-height</parameter> with the same name and
      functionality. It acts as a placeholder for the above
        <property>line-height</property> property. The following
      examples do all the same (except for the value <tag
        class="attvalue">normal</tag>). It is assumed, you have a base
      font size of 10pt; negative values in
        <property>line-height</property> are not allowed:</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><tag class="attvalue">normal</tag></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This is the default value. The real value is set by the
            formatter and depends on the font size, usually it is a
            value between 1.0 and 1.2. <remark>Say more about the real
              value</remark></para>

    <para>Unfortunately, the situation with line height in FO is a bit more
      complicated as it first seems. Usually, this is what most people
      expects:</para>
    <screen>First line
 [Gap]
Second Line
 [Gap]
Third Line
 [Gap]</screen>
    <para>However, the <property>line-height</property> property is a
      <quote>half-leading</quote> value which are added before and
      after a line. This leads to the more realistic picture:</para>
    <screen> [1/2 Gap]
First line
 [1/2 Gap]
 [1/2 Gap]
Second Line
 [1/2 Gap]
 [1/2 Gap]
Third Line
 [1/2 Gap]</screen>
    <para>If the line height is constant in each line, the effect is the
      same (except at the top or bottom of a reference area). According
      to the FO specification of <tag class="attribute"
        >line-height</tag> the FO property is a <emphasis
        xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl11/#spacecond">compound
        datatype</emphasis> which has minimum, optimum, maximum, conditionally,
      and precedence. The minimum, optimum, and maximum constraints are
      length</para>
    
    <para>That said, leading has a direct influence on how easy a text
      is read. If the value is too small, consecutive lines gets
      overlapped. If the value is too big, the cohersion of text gets
      lost. Most text requires positive leading. Usually 9pt/11pt,
      10pt/12pt, 11pt/13pt, and 12pt/15pt are the most common (the two
      values depicting the font size and line height).</para>
    <para>According to <personname>

        <citetitle>The Elements of Typographic Style</citetitle> he
      recommends more lead in the following situations (cited from his
      book from page 37):</para>
